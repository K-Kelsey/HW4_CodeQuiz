#Functioning Coding Quiz! HW4
---

This is my code quiz that I completed for week 4's homework.

Here is how to navigat it:
>When the start button is clicked, you will be prompted with a series of five questions with a timer starting at 45sec.
>Once an answer has been chosen, there will be a display feature either indicating the right answer was chosen or that the wrong answer was chosen.
>If in the event that a wrong answer was chosen, the timer will be subtracted by 5sec and your score will be deducted by 10.
>Once the quiz is complete, you will be asked to enter your initals to save your highscore!
>Enjoy!

Here is a sample of how the website will look:

![Homepage](QuizHome)
![Scorepage](QuizScore)

##Lessons learned from the assignment.

>This was a challenging assignment at times, was able to better understand the flow of javascript given that I ran into a few errors trying to format my functions properly

>I try to remind myself to add note sections where I can, but that also gets messy once I start moving around certain chunks of code.

>Displaying data from local storage was a new obstacle to accomplish for me. It took a lot of tweaking and help from third parties but was finally able to get the scores to display the way I was hoping for.

```js
function update_scores() {
    remove_scores();
    var scoresArray = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("userScores")) || [];
    //----------sort scores array by value
    const table = document.getElementById("myTable")


    scoresArray.sort(function(a, b) {

        return b.score - a.score;
    });
    console.log(scoresArray, 'after sort')

    for (let i = 0; i < scoresArray.length; i++) {
        //-------overwrite the existing table

        var row = table.insertRow(i);
        var player_name = row.insertCell(0)
        var player_score = row.insertCell(1)
        player_name.innerHTML += scoresArray[i].name;
        player_score.innerHTML += scoresArray[i].score;
    }

}


```


after the updated scores function was complete, it was important to actually use the function in my endGame eventListener.
```js
endButton.addEventListener('click', function() {

    endButton.classList.add('hide')
    const value = inpValue.value
    console.log(value);



    if (value) {
        let object = {
            name: value,
            score: score
        }
        var stringifiedScores = localStorage.getItem("userScores") || "[]"
        console.log(stringifiedScores)

        var parsedScores = JSON.parse(stringifiedScores)
        console.log(parsedScores)

        parsedScores.push(object)
        var updatedScoresStringified = JSON.stringify(parsedScores)
        console.log(updatedScoresStringified)

        localStorage.setItem("userScores", updatedScoresStringified);
        update_scores()
    }

});
```

>All and all this project was very entertaining to test how much my brain can hold before losing its sanity. Just kidding. It was a very rewarding project with many many lessons gained from it. The lessons are starting to become more clear to me as the course progresses, but needless to say, I am excited to start working with API's that will hopefully make my life as a dev that much easier!
